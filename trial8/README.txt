Hello, I'm Thanish A/L Natarajan. I had create a program about event-driven simulation in CPU. The joblist txt file
contains the storage of each job and its time taken. Memorylist txt file contains memory blocks that divide 50 000
memory locations. This will be done in fixed partition first then will continued by dynamic partition. In both types, 
first fit, best fit and worst fit algorithm will be used to find its performance. Relocatable dynamic partiton is not used
in this program.
